# CS106: Library Information System

## Goals and Objectives

Our primary goal is to design and develop a Library Information System that improves the efficiency of library operations, enhances the user experience for library members, and provides accurate, up-to-date information about available books.

## Problem Statement

The current library system is inefficient and difficult to manage, with no easy way to track book availability or manage member information. Our Library Information System will address these issues, making it easier for library staff to manage books and members and improving the user experience for library members.

## Target Users

Our system will be used by both library staff and members. Staff will use the system to manage books and member information, while members will use the system to view book availability, pre-book books, and manage their own information.

## Key Features

- **Member Management:** Staff can add new members and modify member information.
- **Book Management:** Staff can add new books, modify book information, and track book availability.
- **Book Pre-Booking:** Members can view book availability and pre-book books.
- **Due Date and Overdue Notifications:** The system will log messages in a "due-date" file when the due date of a loaned book is near, and in an "overdue" file when a book is overdue.

## Timeline and Project Constraints

**Design:** 8th June
**Outcome:** 15th June

Our main constraint is the short period of time available to complete the assignment. We will need to manage our time effectively and prioritise tasks to ensure that we meet the deadline.

## Expected Challenges

Given the short timeframe for this project, time management will be a significant challenge. We plan to address this by using the Agile development model and a Kanban board to manage tasks effectively. We also anticipate challenges in implementing some of the more complex features, like the due date and overdue notifications. We will address these challenges by starting with a thorough design and specification process, and by seeking help when needed.

## Team Members and Responsibilities

- [@ThierryGibbons](https://github.com/ThierryGibbons "â€Œ") **:** Responsible for system design
- [@jazman43](https://github.com/jazman43) **:** Responsible for system implementation

## Software Process Model

We will be using an Agile development model for this project. Tasks will be managed using a Kanban board with the following columns: Tasklist, Next Up, In Progress, Review, Done. This approach will allow us to adapt quickly to any changes and ensure continuous improvement.

## Tools, Technologies, IDEs, Programming Languages

- **Version Control:** Github
- **IDE/Framework:** QT6 Creator - C++
- **Programming Language:** C++

We chose Github for version control because it allows us to track and manage changes to our code effectively. We chose QT6 Creator as our IDE because it provides a comprehensive set of tools for GUI development in C++, which we chose for its performance and versatility.

## Success Criteria

Success for this project will mean delivering a fully functional Library Information System that meets all the identified functional requirements, is easy to use for both library staff and members, and is delivered on time. We will also measure success by the feedback we receive from users and stakeholders.
